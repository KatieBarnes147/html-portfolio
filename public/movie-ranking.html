<h1>Great Millenial Movies According to Katie</h1>
<h2>These are just some of my favs.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>1. American Pie</h3>
<p>The original American Pie movie's (4 of them) were so funny and completely inappropriate (should not be a teen movie but was back then lol)</p>
<h3>2. Gladiator</h3>
<p>This movie was suspenseful, exciting and very unpredictable (gore and violence).</p>
<h3>3. Mean Girls</h3>
<p>This movie was literally how High school was in the 90's you had to pick a crowd (bullying, and toxic behavior).</p>
<h3>4. Harold and Kumar</h3>
<p>Harold and Kumar has 3 movies all of which were funny as heck. Another teen movie that is crazy funny but completely inappropriate.</p>
<h3>5. 10 Things I hate about you</h3>
<p>Another teen movie based on the pressures of being a teenager and peer pressure. This movie was full of emotions both happy and sad.</p>
<h3>6. My Girl</h3>
<p>My Girl was a great movie it was very emotional and happiness turned into grief. It would be my first experience as a child and feeling a sense of loss but in a movie of course.</p>
<h3>7. The Notebook</h3>
<p>If you ever been in love you deeply feel the emotions of this movie. Such a great love story!</p>
<h3>8. The Lion King</h3>
<p>I would have to say this movie right here.. this is every millenial child's favorite animated movie! Full of joy and music and emotions.</p>
<h3>9. Scream</h3>
<p>Even is this thriller is not in your top 10 I can guarantee as  millenial you went to the theater to see this with your friends! The mask if the scream serial killer is still a halloween costume of choice today! Every teen back then was like " Wazzzzzuuuuuuppppppppp" lol.</p>
<h3>10. Titanic</h3>
<p>Come on this movie was great back then! Good love story, suspenseful.</p>
